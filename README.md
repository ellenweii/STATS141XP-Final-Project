# STATS141XP-Final-Project
Major Minor Enrollment Dashboard

Multiple Majors Awarded - A Look at Prevalence, Common Combinations, Retention Rate, and Time to Degree

Client: Chancellorâ€™s Office of Data Analytics (CODA)

  Client Request:
  One of the services our office provides to campus staff, faculty, and committees is the creation of dashboards that help surface information and allow end users to customize reports for their needs. Our most common reporting domains center on student data (enrollment, course taking/instructional activity, student outcomes, degrees, etc.), and campus financial and workforce related trends. When creating these dashboards, we often try to find a balance among providing high level summaries or trends of key metrics of interest, providing insight and  visibility into more specific questions or areas of inquiry, and allowing for enough flexibility in the dashboard so users can filter and split the data to produce reports that are most relevant for their school, department, or characteristics of interest.
An area that we frequently receive inquires about but have yet to create a dashboard for is the topic of multiple major and major/minor combinations.
